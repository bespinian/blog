            This blog post is the third part of a three-part series adapted from a GitOps webinar series which we co-produced together with our friends at VSHN.
In this third part, we will show you how you can combine Git, which we introduced in part 1 with Infrastructure as Code, which we introduced in part 2. The combination of these two worlds will lead us to GitOps where we will show you concepts and technologies which enable you to operate your infrastructure and applications entirely using Git repositories.

            This blog post aims to explain how observability and monitoring should be distinguished, what the problems with &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; monitoring are when we deal with distributed cloud systems, and how observability can alleviate these problems. Finally, it roughly outlines how observability should be approached.
Observability vs. Monitoring For detailed accounts of the difference between monitoring and observability, I recommend Cindy Sridharan&rsquo;s book Distributed Systems Observability and Charity Major&rsquo;s various blog posts on the topic (e.

In this second part, we will look into a topic that is crucial to any modern cloud-native environment in order to provide stability and parity across environments: Infrastructure as Code. We will delve into some interesting tools in that realm and compare different concepts and configurations around how to deploy and maintain infrastructure in a sane way.

        <div class="catalogue-line"></div>

        <p>
            The cloud promises transparency into the cost of our applications and technical services. However, Kubernetes, even when managed by one of the big cloud service providers, usually gets charged as a black box, and is often used by dozens or hundreds of applications in your organization.
This post outlines the necessary steps to approach cost transparency for your Kubernetes clusters from an organizational perspective, proposes a high level technical design to start with, and addresses some of the more common challenges and pitfalls.

            This is a step-by-step guide to installing Arch Linux on UEFI with full disk encryption. It deliberately contains no unnecessary words or bling. It is heavily based on the Arch Linux wiki&rsquo;s installation guide, so if you&rsquo;re ever stuck, just refer to it and the rest of the awesome Arch wiki.

        <p>
            Many Kubernetes deployments include Prometheus and Grafana, so application teams can monitor their applications. While using Grafana may be relatively straightforward for many, the Prometheus data model and its query language PromQL is unknown and unintuitive to many developers. This blog post explains how to create a dashboard with a popular set of metrics for your Node.js applications on Kubernetes.
Prerequisites We assume you have access to a Kubernetes cluster with the following components installed:

        <div class="catalogue-line"></div>

        <p>
            When editing a file, it is quite crucial that you can navigate your cursor around rather quickly. Vim and Neovim allow for many ways of doing so which, depending on the situation, can be more or less efficient and useful. This article examines the different ways of moving the cursor and compares them. Here, the term &ldquo;efficiency&rdquo; refers to navigating the cursor with as little time and effort (i.e., the number of keystrokes) as possible.

        <div class="catalogue-line"></div>

        <p>
            Everybody is talking about Bitcoin and its peer currencies. The hype is so great that even small investors, who have no idea about financial constructs, like myself, want to get aboard the investing and trading train. That&rsquo;s why I recently decided to create my own account on GDAX and try my luck.
Trading, at first, was fun, but I realized pretty quickly that I&rsquo;m not the kind of person who wants to watch their dashboard every five minutes.

        <div class="catalogue-line"></div>

        <p>
            WordPress runs a huge portion of all websites on the internet. It, therefore, seems obvious, to run this software on Cloud Foundry. There&rsquo;s just one small problem: WordPress uses the file system to store all uploaded media. On Cloud Foundry and other container based systems, that doesn&rsquo;t work because the container can be restarted at any time, which would remove all stored files. For that reason, we need to externalize all file storage to a separate service.
