In an AWS landing zone setup, you typically have several infrastructure accounts, which create
resources and share them with other member accounts.

A typical AWS landing zone organization structure might look something like this:

The management account contains your definition of the organizational structure. The network account
defines several VPCs with their subnets and routing. In the case of the network resources, you might
share the subnets with your member accounts using the AWS Resource Access Manager, or RAM.

```hcl
# create a subnet in your network account and share it with member accounts
# of your organization.

resource "aws_subnet" "dev_private" {
    ...
    tags = {
        Name = "dev_private"
    }
}

resource "aws_ram_resource_share" "dev_subnets" { ... }

resource "aws_ram_resource_association" "subnet_dev_private" {
    resource_arn       = aws_subnet.dev_private.arn
    resource_share_arn = aws_ram_resource_share.dev_subnets.arn
}

resource "aws_ram_principal_association" "dev_subnets_dev" {
    principal          = data.aws_organizations_organizational_unit.dev.arn
    resource_share_arn = aws_ram_resource_share.example.arn
}
```

So far, so good. Easy and straight-forward. Now let's take a look at what this new subnet looks like
in the member account.

![List of subnets without names](subnets.png)

Well, it worked. But the subnet has no name! This is because the name of a subnet is stored in its
tags (see the Terraform example above). And RAM does not share tags with target accounts. So if we
only have access to the member account, we don't know which subnet to choose, unless we already know
its ID. If you work in UI, this makes it pretty error-prone and your resources might end up using
the wrong subnet. And if you're working with Infrastructure as Code, which you should, you might
have to hard-code these subnet IDs somewhere, which is also mehh.

One simple solution to this would be to grant member accounts read access to subnets in the network
account through a special role. This is not very difficult to set up, but when you need the subnet
information, you always have to assume a role first. In Terraform, this is done through a separate
provider definition, which you need to configure just for this purpose.

You could also just tag the subnets manually in all member accounts. But again, this is not very
pretty.

Enter AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store! This service lets you store simple key-value pairs to be
consumed by other services. And these parameters can even be shared - for a small fee - with other
accounts through RAM. When we create and share our subnets, we just store their ID in an SSM
parameter and share it in the same RAM share with the member accounts. In your IaC definition you
can then pull the subnet ID out of the shared parameter and use it to attach an EC2 instance, for
example.

![Schema of the resource share mechanism](architecture.drawio.png)

Let's complete our Terraform code from above.

```hcl
resource "aws_ssm_parameter" "dev_subnet_ids" {
  name  = "dev-subnet-ids"
  type  = "String"
  tier  = "Advanced"

  value = jsonencode({
    private = aws_subnet.dev_private
  })
}

resource "aws_ram_resource_association" "param_dev_subnet_ids" {
    resource_arn       = aws_ssm_parameter.dev_subnet_ids
    resource_share_arn = aws_ram_resource_share.dev_subnets.arn
}

```

As you can see, we store the value as a JSON object. This makes it easier to share multiple IDs in
the same parameter. This saves a few cents and also makes accessing the values on the other side
faster and simpler.

Make sure the `tier` is set to "Advanced". Standard parameters are not shareable via RAM!

On the consuming side, which will be the member accounts, we can access the subnet IDs simply with
a Terraform data source.

```hcl
# read the ids from the SSM parameter
data "aws_ssm_parameter" "dev_subnet_ids" {
  name = "dev-subnet-ids"
}

# put the ids into a local for easier access
locals {
    subnet_ids = jsondecode(data.aws_ssm_parameter.dev_subnet_ids.value)
}

resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  ...
  subnet_id = local.subnet_ids.private
}
```

That's it. If you use this a lot, you could also put the reading part into a Terraform module and
put the IDs into its output.

For the sake of simplicity, I left some details out. For example the handling of sensitive values
and also the possibility to store SSM parameters hierarchically using paths (see `aws_ssm_parameters_by_path`).
But I'm sure you'll figure that out.

Also, we only shared some subnet ID here. But this method lets you share all sorts of stuff with member
accounts. You could also share the organization structure (IDs of organizational units or the IDs of
other accounts). This allows you to have information in member accounts without having to add
permissions.
